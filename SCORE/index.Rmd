For the course project in MA388 Sabermetrics (AY24-2), students developed an instructional module designed to teach undergraduates students an important concept or technique in statistics using a sports application.  The instructions for constructing these modules were patterned after the requirements of the [SCORE Network](https://scorenetwork.org/index.html).
